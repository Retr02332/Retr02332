## Carlos Andr√©s Bello (Retr0)

## A little about me
Hi, I am **Carlos Bello**, better known in tech industry as **Retr0**. I am 20 years old. I am a web hacker with 3 years of experience. 

I started programming in Python3 when I was 16 years old. Then over time I learnt more about networking, command line and a bit about operating systems.

At 18 years old, I got interested in ethical hacking. I thought it was cool how to take technology to another level, giving it a particular use
to accomplish things that never came up in business logic. I began like everyone else, in the infrastructure part, but it wasn't until 6 months
later when I realized that what I liked the most was hacking web applications.

In my eagerness to better understand the web applications that I hacked, I started in parallel my training in web development. It is beautiful to
build web applications and then to analyze where there may be bugs and how we could leverage that in a web security audit.

In 2021 and 2022 I was a bug hunter at Hackerone. Here I reported high impact vulnerabilities to companies like Yahoo!, Google, KAYAK, NASA,
Cornershop by Uber, AT&T, Logitech, among others. I studied web hacking at **Pentesterlab** and **PortSwigger**.

I am currently a security researcher at Fluid Attacks. I test web apps, Android mobile apps and API'S. In my work I have found multiple CVE's 
which you can find here:

## My skills
I am continuously training myself in topics related to hacking **web applications**, **Android apps** and **API's**.

I use technologies like **Python3** and **node.js** to build tools that allow me to automate my daily activities in order to be much more productive.

I also use **C++** when I need programs with good performance, or when I need low level programming, like interacting with the registers 
(internal state) of hash algorithms, for example.

In **web development**, I usually use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for front-end, and **Django** with some databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite3** for back-end.

I like to spend time looking for security bugs at the apps' code.

## My goals

My purpose for 2023 is to get certified in hacking web, Android and API's applications.

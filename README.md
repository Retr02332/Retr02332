## Carlos Andr√©s Bello (Retr0)

## A little about me
Hi, I'm **Carlos Bello**, better known in the tech industry as **Retr0**.
I'm 20 years old and I started in this wonderful world when I was 16 years old.

At 16 I started programming in Python3, then over time I started learning more about networking, command line and a bit about operating systems.

A few years later, I got interested in ethical hacking. I thought it was cool how I could take technology to another level, giving it a particular
use to accomplish things that never came up in business logic.

I started like everyone else, in the infrastructure part, but it wasn't until 6 months later when I realized that what I liked the most was hacking
web applications. From that moment (18 years old), I started my studies in this area.

In my eagerness to better understand the web applications that I hacked, I started in parallel my training in web development.  It is beautiful to
learn how to build web applications to think and see more clearly where there may be bugs, where a programmer may have made a mistake and how we could
leverage that in a web security audit.

In 2021 and 2022 I was a bug hunter at Hackerone. Here I reported high impact vulnerabilities to companies like Yahoo!, Google, KAYAK, NASA,
Cornershop by Uber, AT&T, Logitech, among others.

I am currently a security researcher at Fluid Attacks. I am a security tester for both web apps, android mobile apps and API'S. In my work I have found
multiple CVE's which you can find here:

## My skills
Currently, I am continuously training myself in topics related to hacking **web applications**, **android** and **API's**.

I continually use technologies like **Python3** and **node.js** to build tools that allow me to automate my daily activities to be much more productive.

I also like to use **C++** when I need programs with good performance, or when I need low level programming, like interacting with the registers (internal state) of hash algorithms, for example.

In **web development**, I usually use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Django** with some databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite3** for the backend.

I like to spend quality time looking at the code of my applications for security bugs. Nowadays, I am studying at **Penteserlab** and **PortSwigger** about **web hacking**.

## My goals

My purpose for this year is to get certified in hacking web, android and API's applications.

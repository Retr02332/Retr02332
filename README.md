## A little about me
Hi, I am **Carlos Bello**, better known in the tech industry as **Retr0**.
I am **19 years old** and I started in this wonderful world when I was **16 years old**.

At 16 I started programming in Python3, then over time I started to learn more about networking, command line, and a little bit about operating systems.

A few years later, I got interested in ethical hacking. I thought it was cool how I could take technology to another level, giving it a particular use to accomplish things that were never raised in business logic.

I started like everyone else, in the infrastructure part, but it was not until 6 months later that I realized that what I liked the most was hacking web applications. From that moment (18 years old), I started my studies in this area.

In my eagerness to better understand the web applications I was hacking, I started in parallel my training in web development. Today, I support these two areas studying, practicing, and continually updating myself in them.

It is beautiful to learn how to build web applications to think and see more clearly where there may be bugs, where a programmer may have made a mistake and how we could leverage that in a web security audit.

## My skills
Currently, I am continually educating myself on topics related to **web development** and **web hacking**. 

I continually use technologies like **Python3** and **node.js** to build tools that allow me to automate my daily activities to be much more productive.

I also like to use **C++** when I need programs with good performance, or when I need low level programming, like interacting with the registers (internal state) of hash algorithms, for example.

In **web development**, I usually use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Django** with some databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite3** for the backend.

I like to spend quality time looking at the code of my applications for security bugs. Nowadays, I am studying at **Penteserlab** and **PortSwigger** about **web hacking**.

## My goals

As I said, I have been very much into web development and web security. That is why I set out for this year to deploy web applications to demonstrate my knowledge acquired in web development (I am currently working on one project. Soon I will have it published on Github).

**Web security** is something that also fascinates me, and I have set myself the challenge of getting certified with **Pentesterlab** and **PortSwigger**, so that next year I can start my way as a **Bug Hunter**.

## TL;DR

Little by little, I will be updating this post to add new skills as well as projects that I will be posting on Github.

I will also soon upload here my profiles on bug bounty platforms, so you can read some of my reports.

Greetings, **Retr0**
